# calc
Fun little lexing & parsing challenge. 

Input: string containing a valid sequence of digits, arithmetic operators, and brackets

Output: result of the arithmetic string, obeying proper order of operations

Todo: 
- write a single pass evaluation solution in C, parse next token, use an operator precedence lookup table and cached previous operator to establish order of operations
- repeat in another language
